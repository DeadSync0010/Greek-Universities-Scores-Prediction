# Greek-Universities-Scores-Prediction
Greetings, This small project of mine was created due to the fact that, a client of mine tasked me to create a site in which, a guest could see all university scores in greece. The fact that, I have some knowledge in AI and that, I wanted to make the site even more valuable, made me to create this model.

The data was gathered through various sites and files due to the fact that, there were no available datasets on some sites such as Kaggle.

Also, the data cleaning was done by me. Some actions that were done are. Firstly, I changed the NaN values. Secondly, I removed the Universities that had a small data pull. Lastly, i converted all the values from floats to integers in the scale of 1000-20000.

The model was produced by h2o auto-ml. The main reason that I used auto-ml and I didnâ€™t produce a model from scratch is that, I know that the auto-ml can produce multiple models in which, one of those models will have the best accuracy. In other words, it was convenient when it comes to time (I was tasked to create a site in which, I have very little experience in. Every minute that I could save, I used it to produce the site and make the database)
